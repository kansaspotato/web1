<h2>CSS 이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank" title="CSS specification">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a>
   is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation
  of a document written in a markup language.[1] Although most often used to set the visual
  style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language
  can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is
  applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript,
  CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages,
  user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.[
  2]CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of presentation and content, including
  aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can
  improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control
  in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML
  pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
  file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
